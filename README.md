## **EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS**

### **AIM:**

To test and compare how an AI model like ChatGPT responds to two types of prompts — **Naïve (unstructured)** and **Basic (structured)** — across multiple real-world scenarios, and to analyze the **quality, accuracy, and depth** of responses produced by each.



### **AI TOOLS REQUIRED:**

* **ChatGPT (GPT-5 or GPT-4)**
* **Google Docs / MS Word** (for documentation)
* **Excel / Google Sheets** (for tabulation and analysis)


### **THEORY & CONCEPT:**

Prompting is the process of giving an instruction or query to an AI language model.
The **prompt quality** directly influences the **quality of AI output**.
There are mainly two categories of prompts:

1. **Naïve Prompt (Unstructured or Broad Prompt):**

   * Vague or minimal context.
   * Leaves too much interpretation to the model.
   * Often gives generic or random outputs.
   * Example: “Tell me something about space.”

2. **Basic Prompt (Structured or Refined Prompt):**

   * Contains clear, detailed, and specific instructions.
   * Guides the model toward a focused goal.
   * Often results in accurate, relevant, and well-organized output.
   * Example: “Explain how black holes are formed in simple terms suitable for a school presentation on space.”



### **OBJECTIVE:**

1. To understand how prompt structure affects AI responses.
2. To compare the performance of naïve and basic prompts under different scenarios.
3. To identify the patterns that produce high-quality AI-generated content.


### **EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE:**

1. **Step 1:** Define two types of prompts (Naïve & Basic).
2. **Step 2:** Select multiple real-life test scenarios where AI is used.
3. **Step 3:** For each scenario, create one naïve prompt and one basic prompt targeting the same task.
4. **Step 4:** Input both prompts into ChatGPT separately and record the outputs.
5. **Step 5:** Evaluate each output based on:

   * *Quality (clarity, relevance)*
   * *Accuracy (factual correctness)*
   * *Depth (detail and reasoning)*
6. **Step 6:** Summarize the findings and analyze how prompt structure impacts AI performance.

**Observation:**
Basic prompts consistently outperform naïve prompts in all metrics.


### **ANALYSIS:**

1. **Impact on Quality:**

   * Naïve prompts led to short, generic responses.
   * Basic prompts gave focused, relevant, and creative results with better sentence structure.

2. **Impact on Accuracy:**

   * When facts were required (e.g., “What is AI?”), basic prompts gave precise and correct information.
   * Naïve prompts often skipped important factual details.

3. **Impact on Depth:**

   * Basic prompts produced longer, more meaningful answers with reasoning and examples.
   * Naïve prompts lacked elaboration or contextual understanding.

4. **Consistency Across Scenarios:**

   * Creative and open-ended prompts (like storytelling) showed some variation — naïve prompts occasionally performed decently due to freedom of creativity.
   * However, structured prompts still yielded clearer and more coherent outputs.

5. **Reason for Difference:**

   * ChatGPT relies on context to understand user intent.
   * When prompts are detailed, the model can focus its language generation within clear boundaries, reducing vagueness.

### **CONCLUSION:**

* The **clarity and specificity of prompts** play a major role in determining the effectiveness of AI responses.
* **Basic (structured) prompts** consistently produce **higher-quality, more accurate, and in-depth** responses across almost all test cases.
* **Naïve prompts** may be useful for brainstorming or free-form creativity but lack precision for academic, technical, or professional use.
* Hence, **prompt engineering** is essential to guide AI tools effectively and obtain desired results.
